                    Unity works similar to other application development in that different scenes make up a project much like multiple html pages make up a website. Scenes that we used for this project included: Main; where the gameplay took place, Menu; where the game application would initially load to (containing functioning new game, options, and exit game btns), Pause; where the gameplay would break and an options screen would be present in the UI, and Game Over; where the screen would dim and gameplay would return to the start screen.

            The main areas of animation and modeling for this game were including attack and death animations to enemies, animating the barrel of the gun to light up in sync with shot mp3 sound when shot, adding first-person controller to the map we created, and creating a health and damage system. 

            <br></br>

            To create functionality in Unity we used C# to create interaction between the player and enemies, as well as the score, and health bar.
