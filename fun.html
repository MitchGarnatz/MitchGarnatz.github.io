                <p1>With hopes to expand my knowledge in all areas of development, I have found myself often wanting to create games and learn about animation. </p1>

                <br></br>

                <p1>Firstly shown is a project that I developed after a semester of learning game development in Unity Game Engine. Designing this at the core took inspiration from my love of survival themes games.</p1>

                <p1>The name of this project is Redwoods, designed by myself and two other students I worked with in my game development course. 
                    <br></br>
                    Unity works similar to other application development in that different scenes make up a project much like multiple html pages make up a website. Scenes that we used for this project included: Main; where the gameplay took place, Menu; where the game application would initially load to (containing functioning new game, options, and exit game btns), Pause; where the gameplay would break and an options screen would be present in the UI, and Game Over; where the screen would dim and gameplay would return to the start screen.

            The main areas of animation and modeling for this game were including attack and death animations to enemies, animating the barrel of the gun to light up in sync with shot mp3 sound when shot, adding first-person controller to the map we created, and creating a health and damage system. 

            <br></br>

            To create functionality in Unity we used C# to create interaction between the player and enemies, as well as the score, and health bar.

                <br></br>

                <p1>A great portion of my learning for fun outside of the classroom has been geared in following tutorials online. This project labeled as Quiz Web Application Tutorial was my first real introduction to html, css, and javascript. </p1>

                <br></br>

                <p1>What I enjoyed the most from following along and learning from this tutorial was that I got to see code be turned into appealing visuals. Icons, fonts, and color contrasting made css fun to learn. </p1>

                <h4>Unity World Creation and Third Person Game Development</h4>
                <hr></hr>
                <p1>The last of the projects that I did working with Unity Game Engine were geared towards the open-world third person game type. This project specifically was unfinished, but I learned many helpful skills in creating the ground work for it. </p1>

                <br></br>

                <p1>My intial goal was to create a UI system that would allow players to customise their own third person character such as done in video games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring. However, with lack of access to sprites I steered away from this goal and worked on interactivity and development with worlds.</p1>

            <div class="small-12 large-6 cell">
                <br></br>
                <p1>Some features that I created were:
                    <br></br> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inventory</li>
                        <li>Pickup/Drop Items</li>
                        <li>Adding sprites and physics objects allowing third person controller to interact with them</li>
                        <li>Equip/Unequip clothes, weapons</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br></br>
