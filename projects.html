        <h4>Database and Entity Relationship Model</h4>
        <hr></hr>

        <p1>In the Fall semester of my junior year at St.Thomas I took the course titled Database Design 1. Throughout the semester we learned how to do simple T-sql queries to pull, manipulate, sort, create/execute functions/procedures, and display data from a database.

        <br></br>

        The final assignment for the course is displayed below. This T-sql code is what I implemented to create the HealthCare Database. In order to create the database I first made the entity-relationship model displayed, and created the database from the model. Much importance lied with setting the correct variables as primary and foreign keys.

        <h4>Directed Graph Algorithm</h4>
        <hr></hr>

        <p1>
        Of the many challenges that I have faced in my journey to become a developer, none were more difficult nor more rewarding than my Algorithms course. Below is an assignment given on Directed Graphs which we were given the opportunity to attack using java. 

        <br></br>

        This algorithm was one that I enjoyed because one had to fully understand the structure of a Directed Graph to come up with a solution. Relationships between vertices and directed edges were important in contructing the Directed Graph from the input of an adjacency matrix.

        <h4>BubbleSort in Assembley Language MIPS</h4>
        <hr></hr>

        <p1>
            The project shown in the pictures below was a breakthrough for myself in learning assembley language in my architecture class. I found it actually quite enjoyable to code in assembley in using registers to store values rather than soley using variables like we do in high level languages. 

            <br></br>

            This project specifically requested the user to input a list of numbers (size 3-10) which is will be sorted once each number is individually input by the user. The list is then sorted using a bubbleSort approach and output to the user as shown third image below.
